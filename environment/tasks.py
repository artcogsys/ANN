    Let odds be a vector determining the odds ratio for emitting a certain symbol x = i given state k = j:

        odds = [ P(x = 0 | k = 1) / P(x = 0 | k = 0) ... P(x = n | k = 1) / P(x = n | k = 0) ]

    We define

        p = odds / sum(odds)
        q = (1/odds) / sum(1/odds)

    Let P(x = i | p, q, k) define the probability that the emitted symbol is i given that we have probability vector p and q and
    the true state can be either k = 0 or k = 1. Then

        P(x = i | p, k) = p^k * q^(k-1)

    Note: vector of zeros indicates absence of evidence (starting state)

    Note: a nicer way to generalize this to 2D input is to have the 2D input be a very noisy version of the underlying stimulus
          this makes it an object categorization task. We then have one knob to turn (noise level)

    Note: This code has now been generalized so it can also be used in supervised training. The parameter nsteps when not none indicates
          how many steps are taken in each trial
